Big Data analytics in retail sector is enabling companies to create customer recommendations based on their purchase history thereby resulting in personalized shopping experiences and improved customer service. In our project, we have attempted to use big data analytics and solve problems in the retail industry.

Our specific objective is to obtain and explore data generated by a set of Walmart retail stores. Therefore, we attempt to –

• Analyse past store sales data and identify key trends as well as factors that affect sales.
• Develop an accurate forecasting tool to predict their stores’ sales for all the weeks in a year.

Both these objectives will help us to provide insights into what factors are critical to accurately forecast store sales for Walmart. We aim to build hundreds of models and forecasts for each store-department combination, rather than a single forecast for the entire dataset, which would be extremely time-consuming to do as an sequential operation. We leverage power of distributed programming Spark, where individual worker nodes in a cluster can train a subset of models in parallel with other worker nodes, drastically lowering the time it takes to train the full collection of time-series models.
